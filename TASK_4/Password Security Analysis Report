Password Security Analysis Report
Objective

The objective of this task is to understand how passwords are stored, analyzed, and attacked, and to learn why strong authentication mechanisms are important for system security.

1. How Passwords Are Stored
Hashing

Hashing converts a password into a fixed-length string.

It is a one-way process (cannot be reversed).

Used to securely store passwords.

Encryption

Encryption converts data into a readable form using a key.

It is two-way (can be decrypted).

Not recommended for password storage.

✔ Passwords should always be hashed, not encrypted.

2. Common Hash Types
MD5

Fast but weak

Easily cracked

Not secure today

SHA-1

Stronger than MD5

Still vulnerable

No longer recommended

bcrypt

Slow and secure

Uses salting

Resistant to brute-force attacks

Recommended for password storage

3. Password Hash Generation

Passwords were converted into hashes using hashing algorithms.

Same password produces the same hash unless salting is used.

Salting adds extra security.

4. Cracking Weak Password Hashes

Weak hashes were tested using wordlists.

Common passwords like 123456 or password were cracked easily.

Strong passwords were difficult or impossible to crack.

5. Brute Force vs Dictionary Attacks
Brute Force Attack

Tries all possible combinations

Time-consuming

Effective against short passwords

Dictionary Attack

Uses a list of common passwords

Faster than brute force

Very effective against weak passwords

6. Why Weak Passwords Fail

Easy to guess

Found in common wordlists

Short length

Lack of complexity

✔ Weak passwords are the main reason for account compromise.

7. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring:

Something you know (password)

Something you have (OTP, phone)

Something you are (biometrics)

✔ Even if a password is stolen, MFA prevents unauthorized access.

8. Recommendations for Strong Authentication

Use long and complex passwords

Avoid common words

Enable MFA

Use password managers

Do not reuse passwords

Use secure hashing algorithms (bcrypt)
