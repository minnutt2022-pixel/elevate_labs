# Task 4 - Password Security Analysis

## Objective
To understand how passwords are stored, attacked, and protected using secure authentication practices.

## What I Did
- Learned the difference between password hashing and encryption.
- Studied common hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and bcrypt.
- Generated password hashes for analysis.
- Tested weak password hashes using wordlists.
- Understood brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- Analyzed why weak passwords fail.
- Studied Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and its importance.
- Documented recommendations for strong authentication.

## Key Learnings
- Hashing is safer than encryption for password storage.
- Weak passwords are easy to crack.
- bcrypt provides stronger protection against attacks.
- MFA adds an extra layer of security.

## Tools & Resources Used
- Online hashing tools
- Security articles and documentation

## Outcome
This task improved my understanding of password security and the importance of strong authentication mechanisms.
