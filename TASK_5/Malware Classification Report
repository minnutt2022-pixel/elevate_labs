Malware Classification Report
Objective

The objective of this task is to understand different types of malware, analyze malware detection reports using VirusTotal, study malware behavior and lifecycle, and identify prevention methods to protect systems from malware attacks.

1. Types of Malware
1. Virus

Attaches itself to legitimate files or programs

Requires user action to spread

Can corrupt or delete data

Example: File-infecting viruses

2. Worm

Self-replicating malware

Spreads automatically over networks

Does not require user interaction

Example: Network worms spreading through vulnerabilities

3. Trojan

Disguises itself as legitimate software

Tricks users into installing it

Creates backdoors or steals data

Example: Fake software installers

4. Ransomware

Encrypts user files

Demands ransom for decryption key

Causes major financial and data loss

Example: WannaCry, Locky

2. Malware Analysis Using VirusTotal

Uploaded known malware file hashes to VirusTotal.

VirusTotal scanned the hashes using multiple antivirus engines.

Observed detection results and malware classification.

✔ VirusTotal helps identify whether a file is malicious and what type of malware it is.

3. Detection Report Analysis

Detection ratio shows how many security engines flagged the file.

Malware family and threat labels were identified.

High detection count indicates confirmed malicious behavior.

4. Behavior Indicators

Observed common malware behaviors:

File modification

Registry changes

Network communication with unknown servers

Suspicious process creation

Attempts to disable security features

5. Malware Lifecycle

Delivery – Malware reaches the victim (email, download)

Execution – Malware runs on the system

Persistence – Ensures it stays after reboot

Propagation – Spreads to other systems

Payload – Performs malicious action (data theft, encryption)

6. Malware Spreading Methods

Email attachments

Malicious links

Infected websites

USB devices

Software cracks and pirated tools

7. Prevention Methods

Use updated antivirus software

Keep OS and applications updated

Avoid suspicious links and attachments

Do not download pirated software

Enable firewall and security updates

Use email filtering and web protection

8. Summary of Findings

This task helped classify different malware types and understand their behavior, spread methods, and lifecycle. Analyzing malware hashes on VirusTotal improved awareness of detection techniques and highlighted the importance of preventive security measures.
