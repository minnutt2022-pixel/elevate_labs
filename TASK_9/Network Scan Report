Network Scan Report
Objective

The objective of this task is to scan a local network, identify open ports and running services, detect operating systems, analyze potential vulnerabilities, and document the associated security risks.

1. Local Network Scanning

Performed a scan on the local network to identify active hosts.

Identified devices connected to the same network.

This helps understand the network environment.

2. Identifying Open Ports

Scanned target systems to identify open ports.

Open ports indicate services that are accessible over the network.

Common open ports include:

Port 80 (HTTP)

Port 443 (HTTPS)

Port 22 (SSH)

3. Detecting Services

Identified services running on open ports.

Service detection helps understand what applications are exposed.

Example:

SSH service on port 22

Web server on port 80

4. Operating System Identification

Used OS detection techniques to identify the operating system of target systems.

OS detection helps attackers and defenders understand system behavior.

Identified OS types such as Windows or Linux.

5. Vulnerability Analysis

Analyzed identified services for known vulnerabilities.

Outdated services were flagged as high risk.

Open and unnecessary services increase attack surface.

6. Saving Scan Results

Saved network scan results for documentation and future reference.

Reports can be used for audits and security reviews.

7. Risk Interpretation

Open ports increase exposure to attacks.

Unpatched services may contain known exploits.

Misconfigured systems pose high security risks.

8. Findings Summary

Multiple devices detected on the network.

Several open ports exposing services.

Some services require hardening or closure.

Regular scanning is necessary for network security.

Conclusion

This network scan helped identify exposed services and potential vulnerabilities. Regular network scanning and proper service configuration are essential to reduce security risks and protect network infrastructure.
