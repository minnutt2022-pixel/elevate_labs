# Task 9 - Network Scan Report

## Objective
To analyze the local network by identifying open ports, running services, operating systems, and potential security risks.

## What I Did
- Scanned the local network to identify active hosts.
- Detected open ports on target systems.
- Identified services running on open ports.
- Performed OS detection.
- Analyzed possible vulnerabilities based on exposed services.
- Saved scan results for documentation.
- Interpreted security risks and documented findings.

## Key Learnings
- Importance of network scanning for security visibility.
- Risks associated with open ports and exposed services.
- How OS and service detection help in vulnerability analysis.

## Tools Used
- Network scanning tool (e.g., Nmap)
- Local network environment

## Outcome
This task improved my understanding of network security assessment and risk analysis.
