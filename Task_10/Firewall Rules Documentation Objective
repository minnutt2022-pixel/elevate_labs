Firewall Rules Documentation
Objective

The objective of this task is to understand firewall concepts, configure firewall rules, test network connectivity, analyze firewall logs, and document the security impact of firewall rules.

1. Firewall Concepts

A firewall is a security control that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.

Types of Firewalls

Host-based firewall (UFW, Windows Firewall)

Network firewall

Purpose

Prevent unauthorized access

Allow trusted traffic

Reduce attack surface

2. Firewall Rule Configuration

Configured firewall rules to control network traffic.

Defined rules based on:

Port number

Protocol (TCP/UDP)

Source IP

✔ Rules decide whether traffic is allowed or denied.

3. Allowing and Denying Ports

Allowed essential ports:

Port 22 (SSH)

Port 80 (HTTP)

Port 443 (HTTPS)

Blocked unused or risky ports.

Ensured only required services are accessible.

4. Connectivity Testing

Tested allowed ports to confirm successful connections.

Verified blocked ports were inaccessible.

Ensured firewall rules worked as expected.

5. Log Observation

Reviewed firewall logs to monitor traffic.

Observed allowed and blocked connection attempts.

Logs help detect suspicious activity.

6. Blocking Malicious IP Addresses

Identified suspicious or malicious IP addresses.

Added firewall rules to block those IPs.

Prevented repeated unauthorized access attempts.

7. Firewall Rules Documentation

Documented all firewall rules including:

Allowed ports and services

Blocked ports

Blocked IP addresses

Logging settings

8. Impact Analysis

Reduced network attack surface

Prevented unauthorized access

Improved system security

Enhanced monitoring through logs

Conclusion

This task helped me understand firewall concepts and practical rule configuration. Proper firewall rules play a critical role in protecting systems from network-based attacks and improving overall security posture.
