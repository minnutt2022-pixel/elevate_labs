# Task 2 - OS Security Checklist & Hardening

## Objective
To understand basic operating system security by exploring user accounts, permissions, firewall settings, running processes, and OS hardening practices.

## What I Did
- Installed a Linux virtual machine using VirtualBox (alternative: Windows security settings).
- Explored user accounts, access control, and permission management.
- Learned Linux file permissions using `ls -l`, `chmod`, and `chown`.
- Understood the difference between administrator (root) and standard user privileges.
- Enabled firewall using UFW (Linux) / Windows Defender Firewall.
- Identified running processes and background services.
- Disabled unnecessary services to reduce the attack surface.
- Documented basic OS hardening best practices.

## Key Learnings
- Importance of least privilege access.
- How file permissions protect system files.
- Role of firewalls in OS security.
- Reducing attack surface by disabling unused services.
- Basics of operating system hardening.

## Tools & Resources Used
- VirtualBox
- Linux OS
- System settings & command-line tools
- Online documentation and tutorials

## Outcome
This task helped me gain practical knowledge of operating system security and basic hardening techniques to protect systems from unauthorized access and attacks.
