Packet Capture & Network Traffic Analysis Report
Objective

The objective of this task is to understand basic networking concepts and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark. This includes capturing packets, applying filters, observing TCP handshakes, identifying encrypted and unencrypted traffic, and analyzing DNS queries.

1. Basic Networking Concepts
IP Address

An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.
Example: 192.168.1.1

MAC Address

A MAC address is a physical address assigned to a network interface card.
Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS converts domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Reliable, connection-oriented protocol

Used for web browsing, email, file transfer

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Faster but unreliable

Used for video streaming, DNS, online games

2. Installing Wireshark & Capturing Traffic

Installed Wireshark on the system.

Selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).

Started live packet capture.

Generated traffic by browsing websites.

3. Filtering Packets by Protocol

Used Wireshark display filters to analyze specific traffic:

http → Shows HTTP traffic

dns → Shows DNS queries and responses

tcp → Shows TCP packets

Filtering helps focus on specific protocols and makes analysis easier.

4. Observing TCP Three-Way Handshake

The TCP connection setup involves three steps:

SYN – Client requests connection

SYN-ACK – Server acknowledges request

ACK – Client confirms connection

This handshake ensures reliable communication between client and server.

5. Plain-Text vs Encrypted Traffic

Plain-text traffic:

Example: HTTP

Data can be read directly in packet details

Encrypted traffic:

Example: HTTPS (TLS)

Data is unreadable and protected

✔ Encryption protects sensitive information like passwords.

6. DNS Query Analysis

Captured DNS packets using dns filter.

Observed domain name requests and their corresponding IP addresses.

Understood how DNS resolves domain names before a connection is made.

Example:

Query: www.google.com

Response: IP address of Google server

7. Saving Packet Capture Files

Saved the captured traffic as a .pcap file.

Packet capture files can be reopened later for further analysis or reporting.

8. Observations

Network traffic contains different protocols working together.

TCP ensures reliable communication.

DNS is essential for resolving website names.

Encrypted traffic is safer than plain-text traffic.

Wireshark is a powerful tool for network monitoring and analysis.
