# Task 3 - Packet Capture & Network Traffic Analysis

## Objective
To understand basic networking concepts and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark.

## What I Did
- Learned basic networking concepts such as IP, MAC, DNS, TCP, and UDP.
- Installed Wireshark and captured live network traffic.
- Applied filters to analyze specific protocols like HTTP, DNS, and TCP.
- Observed the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
- Identified plain-text traffic (HTTP) and encrypted traffic (HTTPS).
- Captured and analyzed DNS queries and responses.
- Saved packet capture files (.pcap) for analysis.
- Documented observations in simple language.

## Key Learnings
- How network communication works at the packet level.
- Importance of TCP reliability and DNS resolution.
- Difference between encrypted and unencrypted traffic.
- Practical use of Wireshark for traffic analysis.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Web browser
- Network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet)

## Outcome
This task improved my understanding of network traffic analysis and helped me gain hands-on experience using Wireshark.
