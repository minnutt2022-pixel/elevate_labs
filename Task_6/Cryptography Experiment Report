Cryptography Experiment Report
Objective

The objective of this experiment is to understand basic cryptography concepts, including encryption types, hashing, digital signatures, and real-world applications of cryptography.

1. Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption
Symmetric Encryption

Uses one shared key for encryption and decryption.

Fast and efficient.

Suitable for large data.

Example: AES

Asymmetric Encryption

Uses two keys: public key and private key.

Public key encrypts, private key decrypts.

Slower than symmetric encryption.

Example: RSA

2. File Encryption Using AES

Files were encrypted using the AES algorithm.

AES provides strong security and fast performance.

Same secret key is required for decryption.

 AES is widely used for data protection.

3. RSA Key Generation

Generated an RSA key pair:

Public Key – shared with others

Private Key – kept secret

RSA is mainly used for secure key exchange.

4. Digital Signatures

Digital signatures verify authenticity and integrity of data.

Created using a private key.

Verified using a public key.

Ensures the data is not altered and confirms sender identity.

5. Hashing & Integrity Verification

Files were hashed using cryptographic hash functions.

Hash values change even if a single bit of data changes.

Hashing ensures data integrity.

6. Comparison of Encryption Algorithms
Algorithm	Type	Speed	Usage
AES	Symmetric	Fast	File encryption
RSA	Asymmetric	Slow	Key exchange
Hashing	One-way	Very fast	Integrity check
7. Real-World Applications

HTTPS: Uses encryption to secure web traffic.

VPN: Encrypts network communication.

Email Security: Protects sensitive messages.

Digital Certificates: Use RSA and signatures.

8. Findings & Observations

Symmetric encryption is faster for large data.

Asymmetric encryption is useful for secure key sharing.

Hashing is essential for integrity checks.

Digital signatures add trust and authenticity.

Conclusion

This experiment helped me understand how cryptographic techniques protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Cryptography plays a critical role in securing modern digital communication.
