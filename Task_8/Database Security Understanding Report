Database Security Understanding Report
Objective

The objective of this task is to understand database security risks by identifying injectable parameters, performing SQL injection testing using SQLMap, analyzing the impact of database attacks, and suggesting appropriate security fixes.

1. Identifying Injectable Parameters

Analyzed the web application to identify input fields such as:

Login forms

URL parameters

Search boxes

Observed parameters that accept user input without proper validation.

Identified potential SQL injection points where malicious SQL queries could be injected.

2. Running SQLMap

Used SQLMap, an automated SQL injection testing tool.

Provided the vulnerable URL or request to SQLMap.

Allowed SQLMap to test parameters for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

✔ SQLMap helps automate database exploitation for testing purposes.

3. Extracting Database Names

Once injection was confirmed, SQLMap was used to enumerate databases.

Retrieved the list of available databases on the server.

This indicates improper access control at the database level.

4. Extracting Tables

Selected a target database.

Extracted table names from the database.

Tables such as users, credentials, or sensitive data were identified.

5. Extracting User Data

Extracted data from vulnerable tables.

Sensitive information such as usernames and passwords was accessible.

Demonstrated the risk of data exposure through SQL injection.

6. Impact Analysis

Unauthorized access to confidential data

Data leakage and privacy violation

Possible data modification or deletion

Complete database compromise

Loss of trust and legal consequences

7. Attack Flow Documentation

Identify input parameter

Test parameter for SQL injection

Confirm vulnerability

Enumerate databases

Extract tables

Dump sensitive data

This flow shows how a small vulnerability can lead to full database compromise.

8. Suggested Fixes (Mitigations)
Application-Level Fixes

Use prepared statements (parameterized queries)

Validate and sanitize all user input

Implement proper error handling

Avoid displaying database errors

Database-Level Fixes

Apply least privilege to database users

Disable unnecessary database permissions

Regularly update database software

Security Controls

Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Perform regular security testing

Follow secure coding standards

Conclusion

This task helped in understanding how database vulnerabilities can be exploited using SQL injection tools like SQLMap. Proper input validation, secure coding practices, and strong access controls are essential to protect databases from attacks.
