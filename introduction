1. CIA Triad (Core Principles of Cyber Security)

The CIA Triad represents the three main goals of cyber security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

a) Confidentiality

Confidentiality means protecting data from unauthorized access.

Example:

Bank account details

Passwords and OTPs

Personal chats on WhatsApp

How it is protected:

Strong passwords

Encryption

Two-factor authentication (2FA)

If confidentiality fails, data leaks or privacy breaches occur.

b) Integrity

Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unchanged unless modified by an authorized user.

Example:

Bank balance should not change without a valid transaction

Exam marks should not be altered illegally

How it is protected:

Hashing

Access control

Digital signatures

If integrity fails, data manipulation or fraud happens.

c) Availability

Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed.

Example:

Banking app should work during transactions

Email service should be accessible anytime

Threats to availability:

DDoS attacks

Server failure

Network outage

If availability fails, services become unavailable.

2. Types of Cyber Attackers (Attack Types)
1. Script Kiddies

Beginners with little technical knowledge

Use ready-made hacking tools

Attack for fun or curiosity

2. Insiders

Employees or trusted users

Abuse their authorized access

Can cause serious damage

3. Hacktivists

Hack for political or social reasons

Target government or corporate websites

Aim to spread awareness or protest

4. Nation-State Attackers

Government-sponsored hackers

Highly skilled and well-funded

Target defense, banking, power grids

3. Attack Surface

An attack surface is the total number of entry points where an attacker can try to compromise a system.

Common Attack Surfaces
1. Web Applications

Login forms

Search boxes

File uploads
Attacks: SQL Injection, XSS

2. Mobile Applications

Insecure storage

Weak authentication
Attacks: Data theft, session hijacking

3. APIs

Exposed endpoints

Poor authentication
Attacks: API abuse, data leakage

4. Network

Wi-Fi

Routers

Firewalls
Attacks: Man-in-the-Middle, sniffing

5. Cloud Infrastructure

Misconfigured storage

Public access permissions
Attacks: Data exposure, unauthorized access

4. Real-World Example (Data Flow & Attack Points)

User → Application → Server → Database

Possible Attack Points:

User input → Injection attacks

Data in transit → Man-in-the-Middle

Server → Misconfiguration

Database → Unauthorized access

5. Why Understanding These Is Important

Helps identify security risks

Reduces chances of cyber attacks

Improves secure application design

Prepares for real-world security testing
