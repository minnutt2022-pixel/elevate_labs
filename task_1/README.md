- Studied different types of cyber attackers such as script kiddies, insiders, hacktivists, and nation-state attackers.
- Learned about common attack surfaces including web applications, mobile apps, APIs, networks, and cloud infrastructure.
- Reviewed OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities to understand major web security risks.
- Mapped daily-used applications to possible attack surfaces.
- Understood basic data flow from user to application, server, and database.
- Identified possible attack points in the data flow.

## Key Learnings
