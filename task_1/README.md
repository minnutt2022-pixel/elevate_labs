Task Title

Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

Description

This task focuses on building a strong foundation in cyber security concepts. The objective was to understand core security principles, common attackers, and how systems are exposed to threats through different attack surfaces.

Understood how data flows in applications:

User → Application → Server → Database

Identified possible attack points in this data flow.

Learned the importance of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in web security.

Outcome

This task helped me understand:

Basic cyber security principles

How attacks happen in real systems

Where vulnerabilities usually exist

How applications can be targeted by attackers
