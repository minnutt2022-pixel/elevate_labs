# Task 7 - Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Objective
To identify and analyze common web application vulnerabilities using a vulnerable application and security testing tools.

## What I Did
- Studied OWASP Top 10 web application vulnerabilities.
- Set up a vulnerable application (DVWA / OWASP Juice Shop).
- Intercepted HTTP requests using Burp Suite.
- Tested input fields for SQL Injection.

- Observed application responses to malicious inputs.
- Documented identified vulnerabilities and risks.
- Suggested appropriate mitigation techniques.

## Key Learnings
- How SQL Injection and XSS attacks work.
- Importance of secure input validation.
- Role of security testing tools like Burp Suite.
- Best practices to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used
- DVWA / OWASP Juice Shop
- Burp Suite
- Web Browser

## Outcome
This task improved my understanding of vulnerability assessment and secure web application practices.
