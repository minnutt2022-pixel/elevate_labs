Vulnerability Assessment Report
Objective

The objective of this task is to understand common web application vulnerabilities, test them on a vulnerable application, observe application behavior, and recommend appropriate security mitigations.

1. Understanding OWASP Top 10

OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks. It helps developers and security testers identify common vulnerabilities that attackers frequently exploit.

Common OWASP vulnerabilities include:

SQL Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Broken Authentication

Security Misconfiguration

Sensitive Data Exposure

2. Vulnerable Application Setup

Installed and configured a vulnerable web application such as:

DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
OR

OWASP Juice Shop

These applications are intentionally insecure and used for learning security testing.

3. Intercepting Requests Using Burp Suite

Configured browser proxy settings to route traffic through Burp Suite.

Intercepted HTTP requests sent from the application to the server.

Analyzed request parameters, headers, and responses.

✔ Burp helps understand how data flows between client and server.

4. SQL Injection Testing

Identified input fields vulnerable to SQL Injection.

Injected SQL payloads such as ' OR '1'='1.

Observed changes in application behavior such as:

Unauthorized login

Display of database data

Error messages

✔ This confirms improper input validation.

5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing

Tested input fields with script payloads.

Observed execution of injected scripts in the browser.

Identified reflected or stored XSS vulnerabilities.

✔ XSS allows attackers to run malicious scripts in user browsers.

6. Observing Application Responses

Error messages revealed backend details.

Unexpected responses indicated lack of input sanitization.

Successful attacks confirmed vulnerable endpoints.

7. Documented Vulnerabilities
1. SQL Injection

Impact: Data leakage, authentication bypass

Risk Level: High

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Impact: Session hijacking, phishing

Risk Level: Medium to High

8. Suggested Mitigations
For SQL Injection

Use prepared statements / parameterized queries

Validate and sanitize user input

Implement least privilege for database users

For XSS

Encode output properly

Validate user input

Use Content Security Policy (CSP)

General Mitigations

Follow secure coding practices

Regular vulnerability testing

Apply security patches

Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

Conclusion

This vulnerability assessment helped identify common web application security flaws such as SQL Injection and XSS. Understanding how these vulnerabilities work and how to mitigate them improves the overall security of web applications.
